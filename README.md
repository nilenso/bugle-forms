# Bugle Forms

Simple forms to collect information or conduct surveys.

Like the famed bugle whose simple, no-valve harmonic notes relay instructions
for soldiers to assemble, Bugle Forms helps you easily assemble the information
you need to make your analytics, polls or events work.

Resemblance to the name of any megacorporation is purely incidental.
